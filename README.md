# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Client requested an analysis of ride and city data by each city type (urban, suburban, rural) based on the following parameters: 

- Total number of rides for each city type 
- Total number of drivers for each city type
- The sum of the fares for each city type
- The average fare per ride for each city type
- The average fare per deriver for each city type
- Summary data table

Client requested a line graph comparing city types and the average fares over several months. 

## Results
The data shows that Urban city types have a larger amount of rides, drivers, and higher fares compared to suburban and rural city types. This is expected as urban cities have higher population density and higher cost of living. This would increase the average fare as well as the number of rides.

The line graph illustrates the total fares by city type over time. This gives credence to the results of urban city types having higher rides and fares on average. While the rural fares are higher per ride than urban fares, the overal average is lower due to the sheer amount of urban rides due to dense population.

## Summary
Based on the data frame results, I would recommend that the CEO raise prices by 10% on urban fares. This will raise the average price for urban fares by only $2.45, but create an additional $4000 in revenue. Since urban rides are the highest percentage, this will increase total revenue faster than raising prices on other city types. 

I would also recommend that the CEO look to high additional drivers for suburban cities. By increasing drivers by as little as 5% (roughly 25 drivers) would reduce the average fare per ride, and could increase total number of rides based on lower fares.

Finally, I would recommend that the CEO look at implementing a surcharge for urband rides during peak hours (morning and evening commutes, and weekend evenings) to further increase revenue without having to add headcount of drivers. This would incentivize drivers to drive more during peak hours, due to higher average fare per ride, which would increase the number of fares as there would be more drivers available. While the cost is more to the consumer, those times are the most likely to have ride share needed.
